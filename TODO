Please list here all intended modifications
and all detected bugs

=== EDITING CONVENTION ===
=> Add a "-- done" or "-- fixed" tag when you achieved something
=> '*' indicates stuff to do
=> 'o' indicates done stuff
=> '*o*' indicates partly done stuff
=> Inside a given section, priority goes decreasing.
=> Delete fixed things each new release.

 CODE ISSUES
=============
o use usr rather than zoomlog where needed (isInArea, ...)

======================
 DOCUMENTATION ISSUES
======================
o document all items
* make a vignette, or several (classes, graphics, data handling, graph operations)

=====================
 NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS
=====================
o define classes
o define basic methods
o define constructor(s)
o provide accessors
o make a worldshape dataset
o make a worldgraph.10k dataset, with refined connections and attributes definitions
o make a worldgraph.40k dataset, with refined connections and attributes definitions
o provide plot method
o provide zoom method(s)
o provide points add/removal methods
o provide edge add/removal methods
o provide nodes.attr methods
o provide a method to define connectivity from the @nodes.attr slot.
o provide a method to interact with layers
o use different lwd when plotting edges
o make a rawgraph.10k dataset
o make a rawgraph.40k dataset
o have a method to re-add edges, using a reference object.



==========
 TESTING
==========
o test all relevant components of the bulk code -- done
o check interactivity with layers:
- pay attention to donuts/islands -> badly plotted... badly handled as well ??
- -> badly handled: point.in.polygon is misleaded. Have to contact RB.
