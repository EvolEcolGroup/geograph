\title{Set costs associated to edges based on geographic distances}
\usage{
setDistCosts(x, ...)

\S4method{setDistCosts}{gGraph}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a valid \linkS4class{gGraph}.}

\item{\dots}{other arguments passed to other methods (currently unused).}
}
\value{
For the \linkS4class{gGraph} method, a \linkS4class{gGraph} object
with appropriate weights. Note that former weights will be removed from the
object.
}
\description{
The function \code{setDistCosts} sets the costs of a \linkS4class{gGraph}
object using the geographic distance. The cost associated to an edge is
defined as the great circle distance between the two nodes of this edge.
\code{setDistCosts} actually relies on \code{\link[fields]{rdist.earth}} of
the \code{fields} package.
}
\details{
The notion of 'costs' in the context of \linkS4class{gGraph} objects is
identical to the concept of 'weights' in \linkS4class{graph} (and thus
\linkS4class{graphNEL}) objects. The larger it is for an edge, the less
connectivity there is between the couple of concerned nodes.
