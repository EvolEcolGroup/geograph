\arguments{
\item{reg}{a list of length 2, with its first component being the new x
(longitude) boundaries (a vector of length 2), and its second being new y
(latitude) boundaries (a vector of length 2).}

\item{vec}{a numeric vector of length 4 giving the new coordinates of the
plotting window, in the order: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax.}

\item{name}{a character string giving the name of the bookmark to create (in
\code{geo.bookmark}) or to get back to (in \code{geo.goto}).}
}
\description{
The functions \code{geo.zoomin}, \code{geo.zoomout}, \code{geo.slide},
\code{geo.back}, \code{geo.bookmark} and \code{geo.goto} are used to
navigate interactively in the plot of a \linkS4class{gGraph} object.
}
\details{
\code{geo.zoomin} and \code{geo.zoomout} are used to zoom in and out. For
zooming in, the user has to delimit the opposite corner of the new plotting
area; alternatively, a set of coordinates can be provided. For zooming out,
each click on the screen will zoom out further.\cr

\code{geo.slide} moves the window toward the direction indicated by clicking
in the screen.\cr

\code{geo.back} redraws previous plots each time screen is clicked.\cr

\code{geo.bookmark} sets a bookmark for the current area. If the name for
the bookmark is left to NULL, then the list of currently available bookmarks
is returned.\cr

\code{geo.goto} allows the user to get back to a bookmarked area.\cr

\code{.zoomlog.up} is an auxiliary function used to update the zoom log, by
providing new sets of coordinates.

Whenever clicking is needed, a right-click will stop the function.

\examples{

plot(worldgraph.10k, reset=TRUE)

## zooming in
x.ini <- c(-100,-60)
y.ini <- c(-30,30)
for(i in 0:3){
geo.zoomin(list(x=x.ini + i*60, y=y.ini))
}


\dontrun{
## going back
geo.back() # you have to click !

## zooming in interactively
geo.zoomin() # you have to click !

## zooming out
geo.zoomout() # you have to click !

## moving window
geo.slide() # you have to click !
