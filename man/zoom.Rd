\title{Navigate in the plot of a gGraph object}
\description{
  The functions \code{geo.zoomin}, \code{geo.zoomout}, \code{geo.slide},
  \code{geo.back}, \code{geo.bookmark} and \code{geo.goto} are used to
  navigate interactively in the plot of a \linkS4class{gGraph}
  object.

  \code{geo.zoomin} and \code{geo.zoomout} are used to zoom in and
  out. For zooming in, the user has to delimit the opposite corner of
  the new plotting area; alternatively, a set of coordinates can be
  provided. For zooming out, each click on the screen will
  zoom out further.\cr

  \code{geo.slide} moves the window toward the direction indicated by
  clicking in the screen.\cr

  \code{geo.back} redraws previous plots each time screen is clicked.\cr

  \code{geo.bookmark} sets a bookmark for the current area. If the name
  for the bookmark is left to NULL, then the list of currently available
  bookmarks is returned.\cr

  \code{geo.goto} allows the user to get back to a bookmarked area.\cr
  
  \code{.zoomlog.up} is an auxiliary function used to update the zoom
  log, by providing new sets of coordinates.

  Whenever clicking is needed, a right-click will stop the function.

\usage{
geo.zoomin(reg=NULL)
geo.zoomout()
geo.slide()
geo.back()
geo.bookmark(name=NULL)
geo.goto(name)
.zoomlog.up(vec)
}
\arguments{
  \item{reg}{a list of length 2, with its first component being
    the new x (longitude) boundaries (a vector of length 2), and its second being new y
    (latitude) boundaries (a vector of length 2).}
  \item{vec}{a numeric vector of length 4 giving the new
    coordinates of the plotting window, in the order: xmin, xmax, ymin,
    ymax.}
  \item{name}{a character string giving the name of the bookmark to
    create (in \code{geo.bookmark}) or to get back to (in \code{geo.goto}).}
