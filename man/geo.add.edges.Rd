\title{Add and remove edges from a gGraph object}
\usage{
geo.add.edges(x, mode = c("points", "area", "all"), refObj = "rawgraph.40k")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a valid \linkS4class{gGraph} object.}

\item{mode}{a character string indicating the mode for addition or removal
of edges. 'points': user is expected to click vertices to indicate edges.
'area': user is expected to click two points defining a rectangular area
within which all edges are selected. 'all': all edges from the reference
graph are added to the current object.}

\item{refObj}{a valid \linkS4class{gGraph} object, used as a reference when
adding edges. When selecting an area inside which edges are added, all edges
existing in this area in \code{refObj} are added to \code{x}. Alternatively,
a character string can be provided, corresponding to one of the following
datasets: 'rawgraph.10k', rawgraph.40k'.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{gGraph} object with newly added or removed edges.
}
\description{
The functions \code{geo.add.edges} and \code{geo.remove.edges} allow one to
add or remove edges interactively with a \linkS4class{gGraph} object. When
adding edges, two approaches are possible:\cr - click vertices defining new
edges (mode="points")\cr - select an area in which all edges from a
reference graph are added (mode="area").\cr

## remove edges
geo.remove.edges(worldgraph.10k) # points mode
geo.remove.edges(worldgraph.10k, mode = "area") # area mode

## add edges
geo.add.edges(worldgraph.10k) # points mode
geo.add.edges(worldgraph.10k, mode = "area") # area mode
