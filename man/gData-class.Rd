\title{Formal class "gData"}
\description{
The class \code{gData} is a formal (S4) class storing georeferenced data,
consisting in a set of locations (longitude and latitude) where one or
several variables have been measured. These data are designed to be matched
against a \linkS4class{gGraph} object, each location being assigned to the
closest node of the \linkS4class{gGraph} object.\cr
}
\details{
Note that for several operations on a \code{gData} object, the
\linkS4class{gGraph} object to which it is linked will have to be present in
the same environment.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{coords}}{a matrix of spatial coordinates with two
columns, being respectively longitude (from -180 to 180) and latitude.
Positive numbers are intended as 'east' and 'north', respectively.}

\item{\code{nodes.id}}{a vector of character strings giving the name of the
nodes (of the \linkS4class{gGraph} object) associated to the locations.}

\item{\code{data}}{any kind of data associated to the locations in coords.
For matrix-like objects, rows should correspond to locations.}

\item{\code{gGraph.name}}{a character string the name of the
\linkS4class{gGraph} object against which the object is matched.

Note
that none of these is mandatory: \code{new("gData")} would work, and create
an empty \code{gGraph} object. Also note that a finer matching of locations
against the nodes of a \code{gGraph} object can be achieved after creating
the object, for instance using the \code{closestNode} method.}
}}

\section{Objects from the class gData}{
 \code{gData} objects can be created
by calls to \code{new("gData", ...)}, where '...' can be the following
arguments:

\examples{

hgdp

## plot data
plot(worldgraph.40k, pch = "")
points(hgdp)

## subset and plot data
onlyNorth <- hgdp[hgdp@data$Latitude > 0] # only northern populations

plot(worldgraph.40k, reset = TRUE)
abline(h = 0) # equator
points(onlyNorth, pch.node = 20, cex = 2, col.node = "purple")
