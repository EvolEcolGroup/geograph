\arguments{
\item{x0, y0}{coordinates of points \emph{from} which to draw.}

\item{x1, y1}{coordinates of points \emph{to} which to draw.}

\item{col}{a character string or an integer indicating the color of the
segments.}

\item{lty}{a character string or an integer indicating the type of line.}

\item{lwd}{an integer indicating the line width.}

\item{\dots}{further graphical parameters (from 'par') passed to the
\code{segments} function.}

\item{x}{a valid \linkS4class{gGraph}.}

\value{
NULL.

a logical value is returned.

\description{
A substitute to \code{segments} which correctly draws
segments between locations distant by more than 90 degrees of longitude
(i.e. from one hemisphere to the other). It is used instead of segments, but
it is slower.

This function tests whether a \linkS4class{gGraph} has costs associated
to its edges.

\details{
This low-level function is designed to be called  by other procedures of
\link{geoGraph}. However, it can sometimes be useful by itself. Note that
unlike other functions in \code{geoGraph}, this functions does not
test for the validity of the provided arguments (for speed purposes).
